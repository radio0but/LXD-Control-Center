# LXD Control Center

LXDCC is yet another simple UI for LXD with Django, Subprocess and webssh. 
LXDCC allow you to manage your LXD containers in a simple responsive web interface. This webapp make use of bash and python to automate the most common task you would do on the terminal with lxc command like Starting, Stoping, Restarting and deleting containers. For now you can also launch Ubuntu20 CentOS6 and Arch(latest) containers, i plan on parsing the image repository to allow installing from the LXD Images repositories. Thanks to webssh its now possible to open containers in the terminal ! Its easy to install the project with the install script and there is also a start and a stop script to easily launch webssh and LXDCC in the background. 

I do this project mainly to learn and also make something useful for my other projects. 

Note that you need to have root acces and have LXD installed and initialized. You need a ssh server to use the webssh feature. All the command bellow have to be run as root user. Use the command : _sudo su_ to impersonate the root user if you are using sudo on your system.

Execute the install script to install LXD-Control-Center in your /opt folder:

### Make it excutable :
***
chmod +x ./install.sh
***
### And execute it
***
./install.sh
***
Its gonna ask for an username, an e-mail adress and a password

(You can leave the e-mail adress blank)

## To uninstall or Update

delete the folder /opt/LXD-Control-Center
***
_rm -r  /opt/LXD-Control-Center/_
***
then to update simply rerun the install script

## To start LXDCC:

First you have to make the *start.sh* script executable
***
chmod +x /opt/LXD-Control-Center/start.sh
***
Then run the start script
***
_/opt/LXD-Control-Center/start.sh_ 
***

## Almost Done

to see the UI go to http://localhost:8082/

Go to http://localhost:8082/admin to change your password and add users. Users need to have staff permission to access LXD-Control-Center

## Optional Settings

If you want the app to be visible on the network add your IP or 0.0.0.0 to /opt/LXD-Control-Center/settings.py 
***
_nano /opt/LXD-Control-Center/LXDcontrolCENTER/settings.py_
***
change
***
ALLOWED_HOSTS = ["localhost"]
***
To something like this
***
ALLOWED_HOSTS = ["localhost","Yo.ur.Lo.cal.Ip","exemple.com"]
***
If you make webssh visible on the web make sure you have good passwords. Youre gonna be able to work on your machine from anywhere by using localhost as hostname when connecting to webssh If you access webssh behind a reverse proxy change the variable wsshAdress in /opt/LXD-Control-Center/manage-containers/views.py __from__ _wsshAdress = "http://localhost:8989"_ __to__ wsshAdress = "https://ssh.yourdomain.com" __or__ wsshAdress = "http://yo.url.ocal.ip:8989"   for the terminal command to work properly. access to the machine its running om with the hostname "localhost".
